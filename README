coyote is a compiler of JZWI (język z wykładu improved) language for x86
architecture. I wrote that as a project for university course many years ago,
I put it here to not be forgotten. Language specification has been lost, let
me know if you've got copy of it.

Code (as well as jzwi language itself) is a pile of crap, so feel free to
fix it, submit pull requests or ignore it. :)

Have fun,
Mateusz Kocielski
